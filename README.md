# Crime Rate Analysis Using Multiple Linear Regression & Hypothesis Testing

This project investigates how law enforcement factors and socioeconomic indicators influence crime rates using **multiple linear regression** and **hypothesis testing**, conducted entirely in **Excel**.

## üéØ Objective
To analyze the statistical relationship between crime rates and various factors such as:
- Probability of arrest
- Probability of conviction
- Prison sentencing probability
- Sentence length
- Police per capita
- Population density
- Tax revenue per capita

---

## ‚ùì Key Questions Explored
- Does the probability of arrest significantly reduce crime?
- Is there a measurable effect of conviction probability on crime rates?
- What is the role of sentencing in crime deterrence?
- Do socioeconomic factors (e.g., tax revenue, population density) impact crime?

## üìÅ Dataset
- **Source**: FBI Uniform Crime Report (UCR)
- **Sample Size**: 250 rows
- **Dependent Variable**: Crime Rate
- **Independent Variables**:
  - Probability of arrest
  - Probability of conviction
  - Prison sentence probability
  - Police per capita
  - Sentence length (days)
  - Population density
  - Tax revenue per capita

## üîç Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics and visual inspection using Excel

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
- Conducted in Excel using `LINEST()` and regression toolpak
- **R¬≤ ‚âà 0.85**, indicating strong model fit

| Variable                     | Coefficient | P-Value | Interpretation |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Probability of Arrest       | -0.0818     | < 0.001 | Strong deterrent |
| Probability of Conviction   | -0.0365     | < 0.001 | Strong deterrent |
| Police Per Capita           | +3.45       |  0.017  | May reflect response to crime, not cause |
| Average Sentence Length     | +0.0024     |  0.012  | Longer sentences not effective deterrent |
| Prison Sentence Probability | +0.0061     |  0.44   | Not significant |
| Population Density          | +0.00065    |  0.14   | Not significant |
| Tax Revenue Per Capita      | +0.0000517  |  0.36   | Not significant |

### 3. Hypothesis Testing

#### üìå T-Test: Crime Rate (2024 vs 2019)
- **H‚ÇÄ**: Œº‚Çç‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÇ‚ÇÑ‚Çé = Œº‚Çç‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ‚Çâ‚Çé
- **Result**: p = 0.681 ‚Üí **Fail to reject H‚ÇÄ**
- **Conclusion**: No significant difference in crime rates

#### üìå ANOVA: Crime Rate by Region (Central, West, Urban)
- **H‚ÇÄ**: All regional means are equal
- **Result**: p < 0.05 ‚Üí **Reject H‚ÇÄ**
- **Conclusion**: Regional differences are statistically significant

---

## üìà Key Findings
- Increasing arrest and conviction probabilities is more effective than longer sentences.
- Sentencing severity does **not** correlate with lower crime rates.
- Socioeconomic indicators showed **no significant** direct effect in this model.
- Regional variations in crime rates are **statistically significant**.

## üìÇ Files Included
- `stats_project.pdf` ‚Äì Full written report
- `regression_model.xlsx` ‚Äì Excel regression sheet
- `hypothesis_tests.xlsx` ‚Äì T-test and ANOVA
- (Optional) `crime_data.xlsx` ‚Äì Raw data (if allowed to publish)

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This Excel-based project demonstrates that **certainty of punishment** is a more effective deterrent to crime than its severity, highlighting a need to focus on **law enforcement efficacy** rather than punishment harshness.
